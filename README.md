# Evaluate News (NLP)

The goal of this repo is to be an example of a functional API built on Express and Webpack.

It depends on using a 3rd-part API from **meaning-cloud** to analyze input text and return some values after doing a sentiment analysis

I chose to show the concepts' list of sentimented text as a part of the result
